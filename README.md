# WD LLM Caption Cli

A Python base cli tool for caption images
with [WD series](https://huggingface.co/SmilingWolf), [joy-caption-pre-alpha](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fancyfeast/joy-caption-pre-alpha), [LLama3.2 Vision Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct)
and [Qwen2 VL Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct)models.

## Introduce

If you want to caption a training datasets for Image generation model(Stable Diffusion, Flux, Kolors or others)
This tool can make a caption with danbooru style tags or a nature language description.

### New Changes:

#### 2024.10.09: Build in wheel, now you install this repo from pypi.

```shell
# Install torch base on your GPU driver. e.g.
pip install torch==2.4.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
# Install via pip from pypi
pip install wd_llm_caption
# For CUDA 11.8
pip install -U -r requirements_onnx_cu118.txt
# For CUDA 12.X
pip install -U -r requirements_onnx_cu12x.txt
# CLI
wd-llm-caption --data_path your_data_path
# GUI
wd-llm-caption-gui
```

#### 2024.10.04: Add Qwen2 VL support.

#### 2024.09.30: A simple gui run through gradio now😊

She stands on a balcony with a red railing, overlooking a nighttime cityscape with a prominent, illuminated tower in the background. The city is bustling with lights from various buildings, creating a vibrant, urban atmosphere. The text at the top of the image reads "PUBLISHED ON 2024.07.30," followed by "AN AIGC WORK BY DUKG" and "GENERATED BY STABLE DIFFUSION." Below, there are smaller texts indicating the artist's name and the studio where the image was created. The overall style is high-tech and futuristic, with a blend of cyberpunk and anime aesthetics, highlighting the intersection of human and machine elements in a visually striking and provocative manner.
```

#### Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct

Default LLama3.2 Vision 11B Instruct, no quantization

```text
The image depicts a futuristic scene featuring a humanoid robot standing on a balcony overlooking a cityscape at night. The robot, with its sleek white body and long, straight blonde hair, is positioned in the foreground, gazing back over its shoulder. Its slender, elongated body is adorned with black accents, and it stands on a red railing, its hands resting on the edge.

In the background, a city skyline stretches out, illuminated by the soft glow of streetlights and building lights.

```text
The image depicts a futuristic cityscape at night, with a striking white-haired woman standing in the foreground. She is dressed in a sleek white bodysuit, accentuating her slender figure and medium-sized breasts. Her long, straight hair cascades down her back, framing her face and complementing her bright blue eyes.

## Installation

Python 3.10 works fine.

Open a shell terminal and follow below steps:

```shell
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/fireicewolf/wd-llm-caption-cli.git
cd wd-llm-caption-cli

# create a Python venv
python -m venv .venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install torch
# Install torch base on your GPU driver. e.g.
pip install torch==2.4.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
 
# Base dependencies, models for inference will download via python request libs.
# For WD Caption
pip install -U -r requirements_wd.txt

# If you want load WD models with GPU.
# For CUDA 11.8
pip install -U -r requirements_onnx_cu118.txt
# For CUDA 12.X
pip install -U -r requirements_onnx_cu12x.txt

# For Joy Caption or Llama 3.2 Vision Instruct or Qwen2 VL Instruct
pip install -U -r requirements_llm.txt

# If you want to download or cache model via huggingface hub, install this.
pip install -U -r requirements_huggingface.txt

# If you want to download or cache model via modelscope hub, install this.
pip install -U -r requirements_modelscope.txt
```

## GUI Usage

```shell
python gui.py
```

### GUI options

`--port`  
gradio webui port, default is `8282`  
`--listen`  
allow gradio remote connections  
`--share`  
allow gradio share  
`--inbrowser`
auto open in browser  
`--log_level`  
set log level [`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`],  
default is `INFO`

## CLI Simple Usage

Default will use both wd and llm caption to caption images,  
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct on Hugging Face is a gated models.  
Joy caption used Meta Llama 3.1 8B, on Hugging Face it is a gated models,  
so you need get access on Hugging Face first.  
Then add `HF_TOKEN` to your environment variable.

Windows Powershell

```shell
$Env:HF_TOKEN="yourhftoken"
```

Windows CMD

```shell
set HF_TOKEN="yourhftoken"
```

Mac or Linux shell

```shell
export HF_TOKEN="yourhftoken"
```

In python script

```python
import os

os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "yourhftoken"
```

__Make sure your python venv has been activated first!__

```shell
python caption.py --data_path your_datasets_path
```

To run with more options, You can find help by run with this or see at [Options](#options)

```shell
python caption.py -h
```
